# Tohil-Staging
Tohil - Wildfire intelligence system 
Named after the Mayan god of fire ‚Äî symbolizes both the life-giving warmth that sustained ancient civilizations and the destructive force that demands respect. Our platform embraces this duality, creating a digital ecosystem that alerts authorities and guides citizens during wildfire threats, helping communities act swiftly and stay safe.

## üî• Wildfire hazard Data Model

Stores all wildfire alert events that are shown in the web application. Each document contains telemetry data, classification, map zone, status, and recommendations for citizens and authorities.
