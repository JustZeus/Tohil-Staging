Named after the Mayan god of fire â€” symbolizes both the life-giving warmth that sustained ancient civilizations and the destructive force that demands respect. Our platform embraces this duality, creating a digital ecosystem that alerts authorities and guides citizens during wildfire threats, helping communities act swiftly and stay safe.
